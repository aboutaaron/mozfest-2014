__What tool are you reinventing?__

We are reinventing the tape recorder

__What do journalists use this tool for?__

Recording interviews to a) properly capture audio to be used for clips, b) have transaction of what was said

__How can you make this tool better, i.e., how are you reinventing it?__

The big challenge with recording audio is to make sure that quality is good and the content of the recorded clips is sufficiently informative to be useful for storytelling. Our app will let users load questions ahead of time and set the nominal suggested length as short, medium or long. These length values can be set in app-level settings.

During the interview, the interviewer will start the interview and then tap to advance to the next question as the conversation progresses. Each question is recorded as an audio clip and then analyzed. If a an audio clip failes validation (length, background noise, low levels, high levels, etc.) then the question is re-inserted into the question queue at an appropriate place and with an error message prompting the interviewer to ask again.
